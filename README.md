I think it will be interesting to see what people want to add to this. Obviously being the internet I don't expect anything good to come of it.

1. Clone ( git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/anything.js.git )
1. Branch ( git checkout -b your-feature )
2. Make a new file in ./src/ with the name of your function. ( functionName.js )

We'd also like your pull request to adhere to the coding style we're already using, which is the following:

# Contributing guidelines

We will still merge your pull request if it doesn't follow the guidelines, although deep in our soul we'll hate you.

1. As this project is moving quickly, you want to always make sure your master branch is up-to-date before creating a branch to develop your feature. See [this resource](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) for a guide on how to update your local branch.
1. 4 spaces indentation.
1. Line endings are LF/UNIX style (`\n`), not CRLF/Windows style (`\r\n`).
1. We democratically™ voted for using `var funcName = function(){}` over `function funcName() {}` if you're cool with it.
1. Same goes for braces: we'd like you to put it on the same line of the function declaration, if, switch, else, whatever. If you want to argue about it, please go to r/ProgrammerHumor, they'll _love_ to argue about it.
